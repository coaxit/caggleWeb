To make life easier for you and everyone else working on this project, please follow this advice:

- Don't directly include styles in this file. Use imported files from ./lib for that.
- Don't directly copy dependencies into lib. Use bower to install them.
- Use multiple imported files, don't cram all styles into one giant file.
- Seperate files sensibly, so that related concepts are close to one another
  This point needs some explanation:
  BAD:  Separating out mediaqueries. If you need to change one element, you now have to look in multiple files.
  GOOD: Separating out style for tables. <table> is a complex element that is used on many pages and doesn't
        concern other elements. A file containing everything needed to style tables can be very helpful.
  Think about what an optimal unit of work is and put that in one scss file.
